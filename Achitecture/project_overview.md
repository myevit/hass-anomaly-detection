When using Home Assistant intensively to create a smart, context-aware, and automated home environment‚Äîespecially for anomaly detection and advanced automation‚Äîyou‚Äôd typically install a broad range of sensors and data sources across different categories:

‚∏ª

üîß Essential Sensors & Data Sources (the basics)

These provide the foundational data for most automations and insights.
‚Ä¢ Temperature sensors (indoor/outdoor, room-by-room)
‚Ä¢ Humidity sensors
‚Ä¢ Motion sensors (PIR or mmWave, for presence/absence detection)
‚Ä¢ Contact sensors (doors, windows, fridge, mailbox)
‚Ä¢ Light sensors (illuminance) ‚Äì to trigger based on ambient light
‚Ä¢ Power & energy meters (whole-house, per-outlet, or per-appliance)
‚Ä¢ Smart plugs with power monitoring
‚Ä¢ Smart thermostats (e.g., Ecobee, Nest)
‚Ä¢ Occupancy sensors (e.g., mmWave or people counters)
‚Ä¢ Leak/water sensors
‚Ä¢ Smoke/CO detectors (connected)
‚Ä¢ Air quality sensors (PM2.5, CO2, VOCs)

‚∏ª

üß† Contextual & Behavioral Inputs

These allow Home Assistant to understand your patterns and tailor automations.
‚Ä¢ Smartphone presence tracking (via WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth)
‚Ä¢ WiFi device tracker (e.g., Unifi, Fritz, OpenWRT integration)
‚Ä¢ Bluetooth device tracking (e.g., via ESPHome or ESP32 beacons)
‚Ä¢ Calendar integrations (Google, Apple, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Sleep state sensors (via smart bed, wearable integrations)
‚Ä¢ Weather data (local sensor or via APIs like OpenWeatherMap)
‚Ä¢ Sun elevation (sunrise/sunset, already built-in to HA)

‚∏ª

üè† Infrastructure & Mechanical System Monitoring

To manage home health and energy use.
‚Ä¢ HVAC status monitoring (fan, cooling/heating, temp targets)
‚Ä¢ Boiler/furnace on/off sensor
‚Ä¢ Water consumption meters (pulse meters or smart meters)
‚Ä¢ Gas usage sensors (pulse or smart meter)
‚Ä¢ Solar production meters
‚Ä¢ Battery storage monitoring (if applicable)
‚Ä¢ UPS status (e.g., via NUT integration)

‚∏ª

üñºÔ∏è Security & Surveillance Inputs

Important for anomaly detection or securing home access.
‚Ä¢ Cameras (RTSP/ONVIF compatible for image processing)
‚Ä¢ AI person/object detection (e.g., Frigate, Deepstack, Doods, Sighthound)
‚Ä¢ Doorbell camera integrations
‚Ä¢ Alarm system integrations (via MQTT, Envisalink, etc.)
‚Ä¢ Glass break sensors

‚∏ª

üîÑ Automation-Ready Outputs/Actuators

These aren‚Äôt sensors, but they‚Äôre often linked tightly to sensor readings.
‚Ä¢ Smart switches/dimmers
‚Ä¢ Smart bulbs (with brightness and color temp)
‚Ä¢ Blinds/shades (automated)
‚Ä¢ Smart locks
‚Ä¢ Garage door openers
‚Ä¢ Irrigation systems
‚Ä¢ Fans, vents, dehumidifiers, heaters

‚∏ª

üß™ Specialized/Experimental Sensors (Advanced Use Cases)

Useful for anomaly detection or time-of-day behavior comparison like your idea.
‚Ä¢ Vibration sensors (e.g., on appliances or beds)
‚Ä¢ Weight sensors (under beds, chairs, fridges)
‚Ä¢ Sound sensors (sound level, noise classification)
‚Ä¢ Presence via mmWave (e.g., LD2410B, Aqara FP2, Seeed SenseCAP)
‚Ä¢ Custom ESPHome sensors (anything analog or digital)
‚Ä¢ Energy disaggregation via AI (e.g., Home Assistant + Emporia + NILM)

‚∏ª

üß© Integration Tools & Meta-sources

Used to connect and interpret all the above.
‚Ä¢ Zigbee/Z-Wave hubs (e.g., ZHA, Zigbee2MQTT, Z-Wave JS)
‚Ä¢ MQTT brokers
‚Ä¢ Node-RED for advanced automations
‚Ä¢ ESPHome / Tasmota devices
‚Ä¢ InfluxDB + Grafana for long-term analysis
‚Ä¢ Machine learning integrations (e.g., anomaly detection, Home Assistant ML Toolkit)

2. for now let's focus on once an hour analysis,
3. Should the AI distinguish between different types of anomalies (e.g. security risk, system malfunction, unusual behavior)? - Of corse in the long run it should be autonomous home AI.
4. right now just a notification with proposed action
5. we should be able to use any llm provider with ability to process text and pictures, (maybe audio/video) from security cams. all of it
