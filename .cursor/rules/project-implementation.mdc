# Home Assistant Anomaly Detection Implementation

This project implements a context-aware anomaly detection system for smart homes that integrates with Home Assistant. The system analyzes time-series data to detect unusual patterns in device behavior by considering contextual factors.

## Architecture Overview

The implementation follows this architecture:
- **Data Source**: Home Assistant time-series data stored in InfluxDB
- **Data Processing**: Python-based preprocessing and feature extraction
- **Machine Learning**: Autoformer model for time-series anomaly detection
- **Contextual Analysis**: Time, day, season, and other environmental factors

## Core Files
- [ad.py](mdc:ad.py) Main script that handles data retrieval, processing, and anomaly detection
- [autoformer_model.py](mdc:autoformer_model.py): Contains the Autoformer model implementation for anomaly detection
- [config.py](mdc:config.py): Configuration settings for the application

## Implementation Process

1. **Data Collection**
   - Connect to InfluxDB using the InfluxDBClient
   - Query Home Assistant state and value data
   - Process data in 5-minute time chunks based on configured chunk size
   - Do not use pivot option in InfluxDB query. Pivot in python code.
   - If the request query time window more the a day. Split queries to no more than a day 

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Extract numeric features from sensor values
     - Compute rate of change within the time chunks by finding the difference between maximum and minimum values within each 5-minute chunk
   - Process binary sensors
     - Count state changes within each 5-minute chunk
     - Calculate average time between state changes
   - Use text values as contextual information
   - Extract contextual features (time of day, day of week, season, etc.)
   - Combine features into normalized feature vectors

3. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Use Autoformer model with sequence-to-sequence architecture
   - Analyze time-series patterns to detect deviations
   - Apply threshold-based scoring to identify anomalies
   - Track entity changes during anomalous periods

4. **Model Training**
   - Train the model on collected data
   - Continuous learning to adapt to changing household routines
   - Save model state for future use
   - Option to force retrain when needed

## Anomaly Evaluation

The system evaluates whether situations are anomalous by:
- Comparing predicted values with actual values
- Considering contextual factors (time, day, season)
- Tracking state transitions and durations
- Using statistical thresholds to flag unusual patterns

This implementation enables detection of anomalies like:
- Unusual device state changes at odd hours
- Unexpected energy consumption patterns
- Devices running in conflicting states
- Doors/windows left open at inappropriate times

The system continuously improves as it collects more data about normal household patterns.
