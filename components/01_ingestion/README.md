# 01 â€“ Integration & Data-Ingestion Layer

Status: ðŸš§ **In Progress**

## Purpose

Home Assistant's event stream, MQTT topics, and direct REST/GraphQL pulls are funnelled into a unified message bus (Kafka, Redis Streams, or HA WebSocket). Provides both real-time and hourly snapshot delivery to downstream services.

## Milestones

- [ ] Decide on message-bus technology & schema contract
- [ ] Scaffold producer/consumer code
- [ ] Dockerfile + local dev compose stack
- [ ] CI job with basic unit tests
