When using Home Assistant intensively to create a smart, context-aware, and automated home environment—especially for anomaly detection and advanced automation—you'd typically install a broad range of sensors and data sources across different categories:

⸻

🔧 Essential Sensors & Data Sources (the basics)

These provide the foundational data for most automations and insights.
• Temperature sensors (indoor/outdoor, room-by-room)
• Humidity sensors
• Motion sensors (PIR or mmWave, for presence/absence detection)
• Contact sensors (doors, windows, fridge, mailbox)
• Light sensors (illuminance) – to trigger based on ambient light
• Power & energy meters (whole-house, per-outlet, or per-appliance)
• Smart plugs with power monitoring
• Smart thermostats (e.g., Ecobee, Nest)
• Occupancy sensors (e.g., mmWave or people counters)
• Leak/water sensors
• Smoke/CO detectors (connected)
• Air quality sensors (PM2.5, CO2, VOCs)

⸻

🧠 Contextual & Behavioral Inputs

These allow Home Assistant to understand your patterns and tailor automations.
• Smartphone presence tracking (via WiFi, GPS, Bluetooth)
• WiFi device tracker (e.g., Unifi, Fritz, OpenWRT integration)
• Bluetooth device tracking (e.g., via ESPHome or ESP32 beacons)
• Calendar integrations (Google, Apple, etc.)
• Sleep state sensors (via smart bed, wearable integrations)
• Weather data (local sensor or via APIs like OpenWeatherMap)
• Sun elevation (sunrise/sunset, already built-in to HA)

⸻

🏠 Infrastructure & Mechanical System Monitoring

To manage home health and energy use.
• HVAC status monitoring (fan, cooling/heating, temp targets)
• Boiler/furnace on/off sensor
• Water consumption meters (pulse meters or smart meters)
• Gas usage sensors (pulse or smart meter)
• Solar production meters
• Battery storage monitoring (if applicable)
• UPS status (e.g., via NUT integration)

⸻

🖼️ Security & Surveillance Inputs

Important for anomaly detection or securing home access.
• Cameras (RTSP/ONVIF compatible for image processing)
• AI person/object detection (e.g., Frigate, Deepstack, Doods, Sighthound)
• Doorbell camera integrations
• Alarm system integrations (via MQTT, Envisalink, etc.)
• Glass break sensors

⸻

🔄 Automation-Ready Outputs/Actuators

These aren't sensors, but they're often linked tightly to sensor readings.
• Smart switches/dimmers
• Smart bulbs (with brightness and color temp)
• Blinds/shades (automated)
• Smart locks
• Garage door openers
• Irrigation systems
• Fans, vents, dehumidifiers, heaters

⸻

🧪 Specialized/Experimental Sensors (Advanced Use Cases)

Useful for anomaly detection or time-of-day behavior comparison like your idea.
• Vibration sensors (e.g., on appliances or beds)
• Weight sensors (under beds, chairs, fridges)
• Sound sensors (sound level, noise classification)
• Presence via mmWave (e.g., LD2410B, Aqara FP2, Seeed SenseCAP)
• Custom ESPHome sensors (anything analog or digital)
• Energy disaggregation via AI (e.g., Home Assistant + Emporia + NILM)

⸻

🧩 Integration Tools & Meta-sources

Used to connect and interpret all the above.
• Zigbee/Z-Wave hubs (e.g., ZHA, Zigbee2MQTT, Z-Wave JS)
• MQTT brokers
• Node-RED for advanced automations
• ESPHome / Tasmota devices
• InfluxDB + Grafana for long-term analysis
• Machine learning integrations (e.g., anomaly detection, Home Assistant ML Toolkit)

2. for now let's focus on once an hour analysis,
3. Should the AI distinguish between different types of anomalies (e.g. security risk, system malfunction, unusual behavior)? - Of corse in the long run it should be autonomous home AI.
4. right now just a notification with proposed action
5. we should be able to use any llm provider with ability to process text and pictures, (maybe audio/video) from security cams. all of it

🏗️ Proposed Project Components (High-Level)

Below is a first pass at the discrete building blocks we will develop. Think of them as **independent yet loosely-coupled services** that can be iterated on and deployed in isolation.

1. **Integration & Data-Ingestion Layer**
   • Home Assistant's event stream, MQTT topics, and direct REST/GraphQL pulls are funneled into a unified message bus (e.g. Kafka, Redis Streams, or native HA WebSocket).
   • Responsible for real-time collection as well as scheduled (hourly) historical snapshots.

2. **Time-Series Storage & Feature Store**
   • Optimised database for sensor telemetry (InfluxDB 2.x, TimescaleDB, or Prometheus + Thanos).
   • Separate feature/metadata store (SQL/Parquet) keeps engineered features and labels.

3. **Pre-Processing & Feature Engineering Service**
   • Cleans, resamples, and aggregates raw events.
   • Derives statistical, temporal, and contextual features required by ML/LLM components.

4. **Anomaly Detection Engine**
   • Runs on a schedule (initially hourly) executing statistical or ML models.
   • Publishes structured anomaly events with severity & probable cause.

5. **Visual & Media Analysis Worker** _(optional milestone)_
   • Consumes camera snapshots/Clips, performs object/person detection, and feeds results back to the feature store.

6. **LLM Reasoner & Action Planner**
   • Takes anomaly events + current home context, queries an LLM (OpenAI, Local LLM, etc.) to explain the anomaly and propose an action.
   • Abstracts LLM provider so we can swap models.

7. **Notification & UX Layer**
   • Translates proposals into friendly notifications (HA Companion push, Telegram, iOS Critical alerts, etc.).
   • Presents choices ("approve", "dismiss", "snooze") and records feedback for continual learning.

8. **Automation Executor**
   • If user (or policy) approves, calls the corresponding Home Assistant service to remediate (e.g., turn off leaking valve, switch off forgotten light).

9. **Model Training & Evaluation Pipeline**
   • Offline notebooks/CI jobs to (re)train detection models and validate performance.
   • Versioned via DVC or MLflow.

10. **System Monitoring & Observability**
    • Metrics, logs, and traces for every component (Grafana, Loki, Prometheus).
    • Health dashboards and alerting for component failures.

11. **DevOps & Deployment**
    • Docker Compose / Kubernetes manifests for local dev and production.
    • CI/CD pipelines to build, test, and deploy each microservice.

12. **Documentation & Config Management**
    • Centralised docs (this repo) + example configuration templates.
    • Schema definitions, OpenAPI specs, and Type stubs.

> 📝 **Next step:** pick one component (likely the Data-Ingestion Layer) and scaffold its repo structure, dependencies, and minimal working prototype.
